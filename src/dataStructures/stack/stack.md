# Stack

> [Reference](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/Stacks%20and%20Queues.html)

## What I remember (may or may not be correct)
* LIFO
* Can be implemented with an array or a linked list
* Push items on, pop items off

## Key points
* LIFO
* Limited access (i.e. only have the last item available)
* Normally, it's an "adapter" class, meaning it's implemented on top of another data structure

## Operations
* `peek` - Gets the value of the top of the stack
* `pop` - Removes the latest item off the top of the stack
* `push` - Adds an item to the top of the stack
* `isEmpty` - Determines if the stack is empty or not

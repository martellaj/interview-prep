# Queue

> [Reference](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/Stacks%20and%20Queues.html)

## What I remember (may or may not be correct)
* FIFO
* Enqueue, dequeue
* Can be implemented with a stack or an array

## Key points
* FIFO
* Normally, it's an "adapter" class, meaning it's implemented on top of another data structure

## Operations
* `enqueue` - Adds an item to the queue
* `dequeue` - Removes the oldest item from the queue
